I had never worked with OpenGL before this class however, I was able to create and combine shapes to represent real objects, add texture to the shapes and orient them within a scene, and add lighting to that scene.
  
I followed the flow of the class to design my final 3D scene. Starting in week two, each week we learned about and worked on a new element of creating a 3D scene. Then after practicing what we learned in the weekly assignment, we added that new element, shapes, texture, camera movement, lighting, to the final scene.

It is important to develop a project in a way where you can build off of each previous step ensuring all parts work together.

Computational graphics and visualizations may be something that I use in my career when developing an application for the web or software for offline use. There are many apps and games utilizing this technology. This could also be the first step on the long path to game development.
